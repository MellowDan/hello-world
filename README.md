Name is Dan. Heard this was a good place to develop/contribute to open source projects. Need to get on that so I can hone skills and put something on my portfolio so I can get a job that pays worth a damn. To help support a special woman in my life. But also because I love learning and love to code.

No degree but some college exp. Personally think degrees are overrated anyway. Welp, if you made this far thanks because not very many did if at all. I respect you kinda. 

I hope time here amounts to something productive.
